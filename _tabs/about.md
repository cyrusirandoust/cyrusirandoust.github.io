# whoami

I’m a French-born security architect with over 15 years of international experience helping organisations secure and modernise their Microsoft cloud environments.

My work sits at the crossroads of **Modern Management** and **Security**. I focus on:

- **Endpoint & device management** with **Microsoft Intune** and Windows
- **Identity & access** with **Microsoft Entra**
- **Threat protection & XDR/SIEM** with **Microsoft Defender XDR** and **Microsoft Sentinel**
- **Data protection & compliance** with **Microsoft Purview**
- The broader **Microsoft 365** and **Azure** security ecosystem

I’ve worked across sectors such as defence, justice, finance, transport and sports, always with a strong emphasis on **real-world outcomes**, **governance**, and **operationalising security** with customers and partners.

I deliberately stay **hands-on** while keeping a broad view of IT and cloud. I enjoy designing end-to-end architectures — from endpoint and identity through to data, monitoring and response — and I’m equally comfortable deep-diving with engineers or translating complex risk into clear decisions for executives.

## Cyrus Academy

Under the **Cyrus Academy** banner, I share what I learn with the community and with future generations of Microsoft professionals.

On my channels, I explore:

- **Modern Workplace & Intune** for endpoint and application management  
- **Entra & identity security** for Zero Trust foundations 
- **Defender XDR & Sentinel** for detection and response  
- **Cloud and data protection with Purview** with Microsoft security tools end to end  

My goal is to make advanced scenarios **practical, opinionated, and field-tested** so that others can accelerate their own journeys with Microsoft technologies.
